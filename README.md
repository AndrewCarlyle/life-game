# life-game
Python project to simulate the game of life, and test how different variables affect the simulation.

Current rules/game logic:
1. A player can only eat one "food" per turn, even if their location has more than one

TODO:
Update movement energy so that energy lost is based on % of speed used, rather than distance moved? --> reward faster players
